# NewsRecs

**NewsRecs** is a Java-based news article recommendation system that provides personalized news recommendations tailored to user preferences, search queries, and reading history. The system leverages a pre-trained NLP model from OLLAMA to analyze article content and user feedback, allowing for high-quality recommendations that reflect user interests. 

Key features include a command-line interface (CLI) for user interaction and a robust database setup to store user profiles, preferences, articles, and session data. Users can create accounts, log in, specify their preferred news categories, and rate articles, all of which the recommendation engine uses to refine suggestions. The recommendation engine adapts over time, incorporating user ratings to improve the relevance of suggested articles.
